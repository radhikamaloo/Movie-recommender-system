**Project Description**

1] TITLE: Movie Recommendation System

2] DESCRIPTION:

The project is a movie recommendation system that uses the cosine similarity algorithm to recommend movies based on the similarity of the movie's genre, cast, director, and keywords. The dataset used for this project is from themoviedb.org. The dataset contains 5000 movies and 26 features. The features used for this project are the movie's genre, cast, director, and keywords. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to remove any missing values and to convert the features into a format that can be used by the cosine similarity algorithm.

A web app was made using flask to display the results of the model. The web app takes in a movie title as input and displays the top 10 recommended movies. The web app was deployed on an render.com instance.
